---

# ⚡ Installation

DataForge CLI can be installed in **two different ways** depending on your experience.

---

## 📦 Option 1 — Download as ZIP (Recommended)

If you don't have Git installed, this is the easiest way.

### Step 1

Open the GitHub repository.

### Step 2

Click the green **Code** button.

### Step 3

Select **Download ZIP**.

### Step 4

Extract the downloaded ZIP file anywhere on your computer.

After extracting, you should have a folder similar to this:

```text
DataForge-CLI/
│
├── README.md
├── LICENSE
├── CHANGELOG.md
├── CONTRIBUTING.md
├── SECURITY.md
│
└── dataforge-cli/
    ├── main.py
    ├── requirements.txt
    ├── dataforge/
    └── ...
```

### Step 5

Open the **dataforge-cli** folder.

### Step 6

Open a terminal inside that folder.

On **Windows**:

- Hold **Shift**
- Right click inside the folder
- Select **Open in Terminal**

Or simply open the folder in **Visual Studio Code** and use:

```
Terminal → New Terminal
```

### Step 7

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 8

Run DataForge CLI:

```bash
python main.py
```

On the first launch, DataForge will automatically guide you through the initial setup, including your **Groq API Key**.

---

## 💻 Option 2 — Clone with Git

If you already have Git installed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RabbitGamesDev/DataForge-CLI.git
cd DataForge-CLI/dataforge-cli
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

---

# 🔑 Getting your Groq API Key

DataForge uses Groq to power its AI features.

Getting an API Key only takes a minute.

### Step 1

Create a free account at:

https://console.groq.com/

---

### Step 2

Open:

https://console.groq.com/keys

---

### Step 3

Click

```
Create API Key
```

---

### Step 4

Copy the generated key.

It will look similar to:

```
gsk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

---

### Step 5

Launch DataForge.

During the first execution you'll be asked:

```
Enter your Groq API Key:
```

Paste it and press ENTER.

Your key will be stored locally on your own computer.

---

# 💻 First Run

The first execution only happens once.

DataForge will ask for:

- Your Groq API Key
- Preferred language
- Terminal theme

After that, your configuration is saved automatically.

Future launches skip this setup.
